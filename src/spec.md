# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add high-quality trendy/aesthetic imagery for the Girls’ Aesthetic catalog and ensure the storefront displays the new images.

**Planned changes:**
- Add new static image assets for the Girls’ Aesthetic collection banner and product photos under `frontend/public/assets/generated`.
- Update backend catalog seed data so the Girls’ Aesthetic collection and each of its products reference the new local static asset paths via `imageUrl`.

**User-visible outcome:** The Shop, collection cards, product cards, and product detail pages show the new trendy/aesthetic Girls’ Aesthetic collection and product images with no broken links.
